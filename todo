make pid not leak on exit<<-check_if_works (done in ed02e479e36596394520f036fe2255a58286ba47 (branch: execute-chris))
make [] and {} with $ work
make builtin commands still display error message<<-check_if_works
make $? work


chris:
refactor a bunch of garbage code so other are able to understand it

maybe not so important:
cd with ~ and no arguments

leaks:
cd
